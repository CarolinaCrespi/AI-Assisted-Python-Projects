# AI-Assisted Python Projects

Welcome to my repository! Here, I share small projects and code snippets that I developed with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT through Prompt Engineering.

## Contents

- **Projects:** Each folder contains Python-based projects that were generated with input from ChatGPT and later refined.
- **How they were created:** I used prompts to get code suggestions from AI, and then I modified and tested the code to fit my needs.

## Purpose

This repository is where I document my progress and share ideas on using AI tools to create Python code.

## How to contribute

Feel free to open a pull request or report an issue if you have suggestions or improvements.

## New to using GitHub

This is my first experience using both Python and GitHub to share my work, so please be patient and understanding if there are any mistakes or areas for improvement. I'm learning as I go and would love any constructive feedback. Thanks for checking out my projects!
